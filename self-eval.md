# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
  - It felt pretty amazing. I made some silly mistakes at first but really hunkered down to read the error messages and found my mistakes.
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
  - I am getting too excited to start these challenges that I forget to setup timers and stage check-ins. Litterally everything else falls away. Need to get much better at that.
- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?
  - I think I have the stamina and tools to manage myself but definitely need to continue to work on  taking more breaks and setting up timers. Also, I did get frustrated several times but I was able to figure out my mistakes quickly. When the figureing out takes longer, I'm gonna need to have better strategies in place!
